# Restful-api
- A Restful API built using Express.
- Requires insomnia (or any other) software to test.

## About API's 
- an application programming interface or
api is a way for two computers to talk
to each other using an api is just like
using a website in your browser but
instead of clicking buttons and filling
out forms you write code to explicitly
request data from a server for example
we could visit the nasa website to look
at asteroids or we could use their rest
api to request the raw json data that is
shown on the screen now most apis in the
world are restful which means they
follow a set of rules or constraints
known as representational state transfer.

### Feel free to play around with this sample api and test it 
- Make sure to pull a request whenever you do.
